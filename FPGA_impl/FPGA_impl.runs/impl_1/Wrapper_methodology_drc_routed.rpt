There is a large setup violation of -3.590 ns between vpu_hsa/uart_data_frame[15]_i_2_psdsp/C (clocked by clk100_clk_wiz_0) and uart_data_frame_reg[15]/D (clocked by clk_uart_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#400 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.618 ns between vpu_hsa/uart_data_frame[3]_i_3_psdsp_2/C (clocked by clk100_clk_wiz_0) and uart_data_frame_reg[3]/D (clocked by clk_uart_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#401 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.626 ns between vpu_hsa/uart_data_frame[9]_i_2_psdsp_3/C (clocked by clk100_clk_wiz_0) and uart_data_frame_reg[9]/D (clocked by clk_uart_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#402 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.686 ns between vpu_hsa/uart_data_frame[7]_i_2_psdsp_3/C (clocked by clk100_clk_wiz_0) and uart_data_frame_reg[7]/D (clocked by clk_uart_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to clock(s) clk_100mhz, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pll/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_clk_wiz_0, clkfbout_clk_wiz_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pll/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk100_clk_wiz_0, clk100_clk_wiz_0_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#3 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin pll/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT1 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_uart_clk_wiz_0, clk_uart_clk_wiz_0_1
Related violations: <none>
