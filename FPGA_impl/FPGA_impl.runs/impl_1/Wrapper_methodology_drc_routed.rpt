2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock pll/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk100_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk100_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk100_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk100_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT vpu_hsa/row[1].col[0].left_latches[1][0][3]_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Critical Warning
